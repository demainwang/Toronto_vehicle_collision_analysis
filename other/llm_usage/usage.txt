impact = case_when(
  str_detect(impactype, "Pedestrian") ~ "Pedestrian",
  str_detect(impactype, "Cyclist") ~ "Cyclist"
) %>% factor()  missing values for other impactype cases

ChatGPT-4o
The `case_when()` function assigns values to `impact` only for rows where the conditions are satisfied. For rows that don't match any of the conditions (e.g., where `impactype` doesn't contain "Pedestrian" or "Cyclist"), the resulting value will be `NA` (missing value).

If you want to handle these cases explicitly, you can add a default condition using `TRUE` in `case_when()`. For example:

```r
impact <- case_when(
  str_detect(impactype, "Pedestrian") ~ "Pedestrian",
  str_detect(impactype, "Cyclist") ~ "Cyclist",
  TRUE ~ "Other" # Assigns "Other" to all remaining cases
) %>% factor()
```

### Explanation:
- **`TRUE ~ "Other"`** ensures all unmatched cases are assigned the value "Other" instead of `NA`.
- Using `%>% factor()` will convert `impact` into a factor with levels determined by the unique values assigned by `case_when()`.

### If You Want to Keep Missing Values (`NA`) for Unmatched Cases:
If you'd like to retain the `NA` values for cases that don't match, leave the `TRUE` condition out:

```r
impact <- case_when(
  str_detect(impactype, "Pedestrian") ~ "Pedestrian",
  str_detect(impactype, "Cyclist") ~ "Cyclist"
) %>% factor()
```

This way, all other cases in `impact` will remain `NA`. You can handle those later, for example, by imputing values or filtering them out.

new_data <- data.frame(
  visibility = c("Good", "Poor", "Unknown")
)
occurrence_pred <- fitted(
  occurrence_model, 
  newdata = new_data,
  summary = TRUE
) error new levels not present in training data

ChatGPT-4o
The error occurs because the new levels in the `visibility` variable of `new_data` (e.g., "Unknown") were not present in the training data (`occurrence_train`) when the `occurrence_model` was fitted. The model cannot handle unseen levels in a categorical predictor.

### Solutions:

---

### 1. **Match Levels of `visibility` in `new_data` to Training Data**
   Before predicting, ensure that `new_data` only contains levels present in the training data. You can check the levels of `visibility` in the training data and adjust accordingly:

   ```r
   # Check levels in the training data
   levels(occurrence_train$visibility)

   # Reassign levels in new_data
   new_data$visibility <- factor(
     new_data$visibility,
     levels = levels(occurrence_train$visibility) # Match the levels
   )
   ```

   Any levels in `new_data$visibility` not found in the training data will be treated as `NA` after this adjustment.

---

### 2. **Handle Unseen Levels (e.g., "Unknown")**
   If you need to include new levels (e.g., "Unknown"), you must modify the training data before fitting the model. One way is to group infrequent or unknown categories into a single category like "Other":

   ```r
   occurrence_train$visibility <- fct_explicit_na(
     occurrence_train$visibility, 
     na_level = "Unknown"
   )
   occurrence_train$visibility <- fct_other(
     occurrence_train$visibility, 
     keep = c("Good", "Poor"),
     other_level = "Other"
   )
   ```

   Then, refit the model to account for the updated levels.

---

### 3. **Simplify the Model (if Practical)**
   If handling new levels programmatically becomes complex, consider simplifying the `visibility` variable to fewer levels or encoding it numerically, where possible.

---

### 4. **Impute Missing or Unseen Levels**
   Replace unseen levels with a default category like "Unknown" or "Other" in the `new_data`:

   ```r
   new_data$visibility <- fct_other(
     new_data$visibility,
     keep = levels(occurrence_train$visibility),
     other_level = "Other"
   )
   ```

---

### Example Workflow

Here’s a complete example:

```r
# Ensure new_data matches the levels of the training data
new_data$visibility <- factor(
  new_data$visibility,
  levels = levels(occurrence_train$visibility)
)

# Handle NA levels in new_data
new_data$visibility[is.na(new_data$visibility)] <- "Other"

# Predict
occurrence_pred <- fitted(
  occurrence_model, 
  newdata = new_data,
  summary = TRUE
)
```

This workflow ensures compatibility between `new_data` and the fitted model.

hour = as.numeric(substr(time, 1, 2))
is_rush_hour = factor(ifelse(hour %in% c(7:9, 16:18), "Yes", "No")) how can I adjust the is_rush_hour feature to account for seasonal variations in rush hours

ChatGPT-4o
To adjust the `is_rush_hour` feature for **seasonal variations in rush hours**, you can incorporate the season as an additional factor. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

---

### 1. **Define Seasonal Rush Hour Patterns**
Determine the rush hour periods for each season based on your data or domain knowledge. For example:
- **Winter:** Rush hours may start later due to shorter daylight hours.
- **Summer:** Rush hours may extend later in the evening.

---

### 2. **Add a Season Variable**
You need to determine the season based on the date or time information in your dataset. For example:

```r
# Create a 'season' variable based on the date
date <- as.Date(date_column)  # Replace 'date_column' with your actual column name
month <- as.numeric(format(date, "%m"))

season <- factor(
  case_when(
    month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter",
    month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
    month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
    month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Fall"
  )
)
```

---

### 3. **Adjust Rush Hour Definitions by Season**
Define rush hours for each season. For example:

```r
# Create a rush hour feature considering seasonal variations
is_rush_hour <- case_when(
  season == "Winter" & hour %in% c(8:10, 16:19) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Spring" & hour %in% c(7:9, 16:18) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Summer" & hour %in% c(6:9, 17:20) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Fall"   & hour %in% c(7:9, 16:18) ~ "Yes",
  TRUE ~ "No"
) %>% factor()
```

Here:
- The rush hours for **Winter**, **Spring**, **Summer**, and **Fall** are adjusted separately.
- Use your specific knowledge or data patterns to refine the hour ranges.

---

### 4. **Integrate into the Dataset**
Incorporate the new `is_rush_hour` feature into your dataset, ensuring it accounts for both the hour and the season.

---

### 5. **Verify the Impact**
Check how the updated feature affects the model:
- Use exploratory data analysis to see how rush hour varies by season.
- Refit the model with the updated `is_rush_hour` and examine changes in model performance.

---

### Complete Example

```r
# Extract hour
hour <- as.numeric(substr(time, 1, 2))

# Define season
date <- as.Date(date_column)  # Replace 'date_column' with your actual column
month <- as.numeric(format(date, "%m"))
season <- factor(
  case_when(
    month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter",
    month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
    month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
    month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Fall"
  )
)

# Adjust rush hour by season
is_rush_hour <- case_when(
  season == "Winter" & hour %in% c(8:10, 16:19) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Spring" & hour %in% c(7:9, 16:18) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Summer" & hour %in% c(6:9, 17:20) ~ "Yes",
  season == "Fall"   & hour %in% c(7:9, 16:18) ~ "Yes",
  TRUE ~ "No"
) %>% factor()
```

This approach captures both the **time of day** and **seasonal variations**, allowing your model to better account for context-specific rush hour patterns.

occurrence_model <- brm(
  injury_occurred ~ visibility + light + rdsfcond,
  data = occurrence_train,
  family = bernoulli(),
  prior = priors_occurrence,
  chains = 2,
  iter = 2000
) how can I balance computation time and model accuracy when increasing chains, iterand warmup for ayesian models


ChatGpt-4o
Balancing computation time and model accuracy when increasing `chains`, `iter`, and `warmup` in Bayesian models like those created with `brms` involves strategic choices to optimize model performance without excessive computation. Here's a guide:

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Chains**:
   - Increasing the number of chains improves the exploration of the posterior distribution but also increases computation time linearly.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Use at least 4 chains for robust diagnostics (e.g., `R-hat` values).
     - If computational resources are limited, 2 chains can be used, but check convergence diagnostics carefully.

2. **Iterations (`iter`)**:
   - More iterations improve the accuracy of posterior estimates but at a quadratic cost (chains × iterations).
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Start with a moderate value (e.g., `iter = 2000`).
     - Increase iter gradually if effective sample size (`n_eff`) is low or `R-hat` > 1.01 for key parameters.

3. **Warmup**:
   - The `warmup` phase is used to tune the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler.
   - Increasing warmup can help reduce divergences and improve convergence but doesn’t contribute directly to the effective sample size.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Use about 50% of total iterations for warmup (e.g., `warmup = 1000` for `iter = 2000`).

---

### **Strategies for Balancing Accuracy and Computation Time**
#### 1. **Start with a Simpler Model**
   - Use fewer predictors initially to test the model’s computational feasibility.
   - Gradually add complexity to assess how computation time scales.

#### 2. **Optimize Hyperparameters**
   - **`adapt_delta`:** Controls the step size in the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. A higher `adapt_delta` (e.g., 0.95–0.99) reduces divergences but slows computation.
     - Start with `adapt_delta = 0.95` and increase if you observe divergent transitions.
   - **`max_treedepth`:** Controls the depth of the leapfrog integrator. Increase it only if warnings about exceeding treedepth appear.

   ```r
   control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 12)
   ```

#### 3. **Parallelize Chains**
   - Run chains in parallel to reduce computation time. Use the `future` package to enable parallel execution:
     ```r
     library(future)
     plan(multicore)
     occurrence_model <- brm(
       injury_occurred ~ visibility + light + rdsfcond,
       data = occurrence_train,
       family = bernoulli(),
       prior = priors_occurrence,
       chains = 4,
       iter = 2000,
       warmup = 1000
     )
     ```

#### 4. **Monitor Effective Sample Size**
   - After fitting, check the effective sample size (`n_eff`). If key parameters have low `n_eff`, increase `iter` but only for the parameters with issues.

#### 5. **Use Prior Predictive Checks**
   - Perform prior predictive checks before fitting the full model. This helps diagnose prior misspecifications early, avoiding wasted computation on non-converging models.

#### 6. **Incremental Iteration Tuning**
   - Start with fewer iterations (e.g., `iter = 1000`) to test convergence.
   - Gradually increase iterations (e.g., to `iter = 2000–4000`) only if diagnostics suggest the need.

---

### Example Workflow
Here’s how you might adjust hyperparameters:

```r
occurrence_model <- brm(
  injury_occurred ~ visibility + light + rdsfcond,
  data = occurrence_train,
  family = bernoulli(),
  prior = priors_occurrence,
  chains = 4,                    # Increase chains for better convergence diagnostics
  iter = 3000,                   # Moderate number of iterations
  warmup = 1500,                 # Half of iterations used for warmup
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 12),  # Tuning controls
  seed = 123                     # Ensures reproducibility
)
```

---

### Diagnostics to Monitor
1. **`R-hat` Values**:
   - Should be ≤1.01 for all parameters.
2. **Effective Sample Size (`n_eff`)**:
   - Should be sufficiently large (rule of thumb: ≥100 per parameter).
3. **Divergences**:
   - Should be avoided or minimized.
4. **Trace Plots**:
   - Chains should mix well and show no clear patterns or sticking.

---

### Trade-offs
If computational resources are tight:
- Reduce chains to 2 but check convergence carefully.
- Use fewer predictors or simplify the model.
- Use informative priors to reduce the exploration needed by the sampler.

By incrementally increasing complexity and monitoring diagnostics, you can achieve a balance between computation time and accuracy.

  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
) what diagnostics should I check if the model does not converge

ChatGPT-4o
If your Bayesian regression model (`brm` in the `brms` package) does not converge, you should investigate the following diagnostics and make adjustments as needed:

---

### 1. **R-hat Values**
   - Check the `R-hat` values for all parameters. Values greater than **1.01** suggest lack of convergence.
   - Use `summary(occurrence_model)` to inspect these values.

### 2. **Effective Sample Size (n_eff)**
   - Ensure a sufficiently large effective sample size for each parameter. Small values indicate poor mixing of the chains.
   - Check `n_eff` in the summary output.

---

### 3. **Trace Plots**
   - Use `plot(occurrence_model)` to visualize trace plots for all parameters. Chains should mix well, appearing as "hairy caterpillars" without sticking or diverging.

---

### 4. **Divergent Transitions**
   - Check for warnings about divergent transitions in the model output.
   - Use `check_hmc_diagnostics(occurrence_model)` for detailed diagnostics.

---

### 5. **Posterior Distribution**
   - Look for oddly shaped posterior distributions or extreme skewness in parameter estimates.

---

### Steps to Improve Convergence:

1. **Increase `adapt_delta`:**
   - If divergent transitions occur, increase the `adapt_delta` (e.g., `control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)`).

2. **Increase Iterations:**
   - Increase `iter` to allow more samples, e.g., `iter = 8000`.

3. **Reparameterize the Model:**
   - Inspect the priors (`priors_occurrence`). Overly tight or vague priors can hinder convergence.
   - Simplify the model by reducing the number of predictors if multicollinearity or weak data support is suspected.

4. **Center and Scale Predictors:**
   - Standardizing predictors can stabilize sampling.

5. **Check for Multicollinearity:**
   - Use a variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis on the predictors to check for collinearity issues.

6. **Increase the Number of Chains:**
   - Running more chains (e.g., `chains = 6`) may help capture the posterior distribution more effectively.

7. **Inspect Data Quality:**
   - Check for outliers, missing values, or highly imbalanced classes in `occurrence_train`.

8. **Model Simpler Versions:**
   - Start with fewer predictors and incrementally add more complexity.

[1] "RMSE (Injury Severity Model): NaN"

ChatGPT-4o
If your result for the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in your Injury Severity Model is coming up as NaN, it typically indicates an issue with the calculation. Here are some common causes and their potential solutions:

1. Missing Values in Data
Problem: If your predictions or actual values contain missing (NaN) values, the RMSE calculation will also result in NaN.
Solution:
Check for missing values in both the actual (y_true) and predicted (y_pred) datasets.
Use .isnull().sum() or similar functions to identify and handle missing data.
import pandas as pd
print(pd.Series(y_true).isnull().sum())
print(pd.Series(y_pred).isnull().sum())
Then, drop or impute missing values before calculating RMSE.
2. Division by Zero
Problem: If the dataset is empty or has zero variance in y_true, the calculation might fail.
Solution:
Ensure y_true and y_pred are non-empty and contain valid numerical values.
if len(y_true) == 0 or len(y_pred) == 0:
    print("Error: Empty datasets")
3. Incorrect Calculation Formula
Problem: Ensure the RMSE formula is being applied correctly. The typical formula is:
Solution:
Verify your implementation of RMSE. A simple Python code snippet for RMSE:
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))
4. Model Outputs NaN Predictions
Problem: If your model predictions (y_pred) are all NaN, it could be due to issues during model training or inference.
Solution:
Check your model's output for NaN values.
Debug your model to ensure it's learning properly and is not encountering issues like division by zero, invalid operations, or improperly scaled inputs.
print(y_pred)
5. Mismatched Dimensions
Problem: The y_true and y_pred arrays may not align in shape or size.
Solution:
Ensure that y_true and y_pred are of the same length.
print(len(y_true), len(y_pred))
If you share more details or context (e.g., the model type, data preprocessing steps, or code snippets), I can assist further in diagnosing the issue.

how to construct a r-hat plot for models

ChatGPT-4o
  (R-hat) plot is commonly used in Bayesian modeling to assess the convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. It visualizes the potential scale reduction factor, 
 , for each parameter, helping to identify convergence issues. In R, this can be constructed using the bayesplot package or by extracting 
  diagnostics from a Bayesian modeling package like rstan, brms, or cmdstanr.

Here’s how you can construct an 
  plot:

1. Install Necessary Libraries
Make sure you have the required packages:

install.packages("bayesplot")
2. Extract 
  Values
If you're using a Bayesian modeling package, extract the 
  values. For example:

For rstan models:
library(rstan)
fit <- stan_model(...)  # Replace with your model
rhats <- rstan::summary(fit)$summary[, "Rhat"]
For brms models:
library(brms)
fit <- brm(...)  # Replace with your model
rhats <- summary(fit)$rhat
For cmdstanr models:
library(cmdstanr)
fit <- cmdstan_model(...)  # Replace with your model
rhats <- posterior::rhat(fit)
3. Plot 
  Values
Use bayesplot to create the 
  plot:

library(bayesplot)

# Example: Assuming `rhats` contains R-hat values
mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
  theme_minimal()
This will create a diagnostic plot showing the 
  values for all parameters. Ideally, all values should be close to 1 (e.g., below 1.1).

4. Customizing the Plot
You can customize the plot further if needed:

mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot: MCMC Diagnostics") +
  xlab("Parameters") +
  ylab("R-hat Values") +
  theme_minimal()
Notes:
Ensure 
  values are close to 1. High 
  values indicate non-convergence or mixing issues.
If the 
  values are extracted in a different format, convert them into a vector or matrix as required by mcmc_rhat.
This will provide a clear visualization of convergence diagnostics for your Bayesian model.

User
rhats <- summary(occurrence_model)$rhat
mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
  theme_minimal() Error in validate_rhat(as_rhat(x)) : is.numeric(x) is not TRUE

ChatGPT-4o
The error indicates that the `mcmc_rhat` function expects a specific format for the \( \hat{R} \) values (numeric and usually named or parameter-specific). The `summary(occurrence_model)$rhat` command might not directly return the \( \hat{R} \) values in the correct structure.

Here’s how you can fix the issue:

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Check the Structure of `summary(occurrence_model)$rhat`:**
   Run:
   ```r
   str(summary(occurrence_model)$rhat)
   ```
   This will tell you the format of the \( \hat{R} \) values extracted. They should ideally be numeric values, either in a vector or matrix.

2. **Ensure the Data is Numeric:**
   If the extracted \( \hat{R} \) values are not numeric or need adjustment, you might need to subset or coerce the data into a numeric vector. For example:
   ```r
   rhats <- as.numeric(summary(occurrence_model)$rhat)
   ```

3. **Pass \( \hat{R} \) Values to `mcmc_rhat`:**
   Ensure the data passed to `mcmc_rhat` is a numeric vector or matrix:
   ```r
   library(bayesplot)

   mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
     ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
     theme_minimal()
   ```

### For Bayesian Models in General
If the `occurrence_model` was fitted using **`rstan`**, **`brms`**, or **`cmdstanr`**, the method to extract \( \hat{R} \) values might differ slightly:

#### Example for `rstan` Models:
```r
rhats <- rstan::summary(occurrence_model)$summary[, "Rhat"]
mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Example for `brms` Models:
```r
rhats <- summary(occurrence_model)$rhat
mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Example for `cmdstanr` Models:
```r
library(posterior)
rhats <- posterior::rhat(occurrence_model)
mcmc_rhat(rhats) +
  ggtitle("R-hat Plot") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### Debugging Tip
If issues persist, double-check the format of the \( \hat{R} \) values. They must be numeric and interpretable by `bayesplot`. If your model doesn’t inherently support \( \hat{R} \) extraction, ensure the diagnostic is appropriate for the model type.

fix this latex $Y_i = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if no injury occurred} \text{ (original classification "None")} \
1 & \text{if any injury occurred} \text{ (original classifications "Minimal", "Minor", "Major", or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}$

ChatGPT-4o
The issue in your LaTeX code is the missing `\\` at the end of each line within the `cases` environment. Here is the corrected version:

```latex
Y_i = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if no injury occurred (original classification "None")} \\ 
1 & \text{if any injury occurred (original classifications "Minimal", "Minor", "Major", or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. **Add `\\` at the End of Each Line**:
   - The `cases` environment requires each line to be terminated with `\\` to separate the rows properly.

2. **Use Proper Escaping for Quotes**:
   - The double quotes (e.g., `"None"`) are fine in standard LaTeX, but ensure your editor recognizes them as part of the text and not as special characters.

### Output Example:
This will render correctly in LaTeX as:

\[
Y_i = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if no injury occurred (original classification "None")} \\ 
1 & \text{if any injury occurred (original classifications "Minimal", "Minor", "Major", or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}
\]


User
$S_i = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if injury was less severe} \text{ (original classifications "Minimal" or "Minor")} \
1 & \text{if injury was severe} \text{ (original classifications "Major" or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}$

ChatGPT-4o
Your LaTeX code for the `cases` environment is missing the `\\` at the end of each line. Here’s the corrected version:

```latex
S_i = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if injury was less severe (original classifications "Minimal" or "Minor")} \\ 
1 & \text{if injury was severe (original classifications "Major" or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. **Add `\\` at the End of Each Line**:
   - The `cases` environment requires each line to end with `\\` to properly separate rows.
   
2. **Ensure Proper Text Wrapping**:
   - The `\text{}` environment ensures that the text is typeset in regular font (not math mode).

### Rendered Output:
When compiled in LaTeX, the above code will render as:

\[
S_i = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if injury was less severe (original classifications "Minimal" or "Minor")} \\ 
1 & \text{if injury was severe (original classifications "Major" or "Fatal")}
\end{cases}
\]

mcmc_trace(as_draws(severity_model), regex_pars = "b_") +
  ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Secerity Model") the render image in pdf does not work well, how can I adjust it

ChatGPT-4o
The rendering issue in your trace plot seems to stem from overlapping text and formatting in the generated PDF. This often happens due to small plot sizes or mismatched font sizes. Here are steps to fix the problem in your code:

### Fix Overlapping and Rendering Issues
1. **Increase the Plot Size**:
   Add parameters to adjust the overall size of the plot.
   ```r
   library(ggplot2)

   mcmc_trace(as_draws(severity_model), regex_pars = "b_") +
     ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Severity Model") +
     theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
     ggsave("trace_plot.pdf", width = 12, height = 8)
   ```
   This increases the dimensions of the saved plot.

2. **Adjust Label Sizes**:
   Modify the text sizes for axes, titles, and legends to reduce clutter:
   ```r
   mcmc_trace(as_draws(severity_model), regex_pars = "b_") +
     ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Severity Model") +
     theme(
       axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
       legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
       plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
     ) +
     ggsave("trace_plot.pdf", width = 12, height = 8)
   ```

3. **Ensure Proper Font Embedding**:
   If the issue persists in PDFs, ensure the fonts are embedded properly:
   ```r
   ggsave("trace_plot.pdf", device = cairo_pdf, width = 12, height = 8)
   ```

4. **Adjust Margins**:
   Increase space between subplots using `facet_wrap` or `theme` parameters:
   ```r
   mcmc_trace(as_draws(severity_model), regex_pars = "b_") +

       plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10),
       legend.position = "bottom"

   ```r
   ggsave("trace_plot.png", dpi = 300, width = 12, height = 8)
   ```

### Debugging Checklist
- Ensure your `severity_model` object is valid and has no anomalies in its `draws` data.
- Test with a simpler parameter set (e.g., `regex_pars = "b_speeding"`).
- Verify your `mcmc_trace()` function works properly by plotting in RStudio before exporting.

how can I modify the label if I put 3 plot in one code chunk, 
{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-trace_o
#| fig-cap: "Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model"
# First 7 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
          regex_pars = "b_(Intercept|visibilityPoor|lightNight|rdsfcondPoor|road_classMajor|road_classMinor|acclocOther)") +
          ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 1")

# Next 7 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
          regex_pars = "b_(acclocPrivate|traffctlOther|traffctlSignal|traffctlStop|impactypeApproaching|impactypeCyclistCollisions|impactypeOther)") +
          ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 2")

# Last 8 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
          regex_pars = "b_(impactypePedestrianCollisions|impactypeRearEnd|impactypeSideswipe|impactypeSMVOther|impactypeSMVUnattendedVehicle|impactypeTurningMovement)") +

To modify the label for each individual plot in a single code chunk, you need to assign unique labels and captions for each plot. Since all three plots are in the same chunk, the chunk itself can only have one global label and caption. However, you can specify separate titles or annotations for each plot using ggplot or `facet_wrap()`.

Here's how you can handle it cleanly:

### Approach 1: Use `patchwork` or `cowplot` for Better Plot Management
You can combine multiple `ggplot` objects into one output using the `patchwork` or `cowplot` library. This allows you to display all three plots with one caption and label, while still giving each subplot its own title.

#### Example with `patchwork`:
```r
library(patchwork)

# Create individual plots
plot1 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(Intercept|visibilityPoor|lightNight|rdsfcondPoor|road_classMajor|road_classMinor|acclocOther)") +
          ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 1")

plot2 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(acclocPrivate|traffctlOther|traffctlSignal|traffctlStop|impactypeApproaching|impactypeCyclistCollisions|impactypeOther)") +
          ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 2")

plot3 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(impactypePedestrianCollisions|impactypeRearEnd|impactypeSideswipe|impactypeSMVOther|impactypeSMVUnattendedVehicle|impactypeTurningMovement)") +
          ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 3")

# Combine the plots
plot1 / plot2 / plot3 + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model", 
                  caption = "This figure includes all parameter groups.")
```

This outputs a single plot with combined sections and allows you to manage all titles and captions.

---

### Approach 2: Separate Captions in R Markdown Text
You can insert captions for each plot as inline text in R Markdown, making the plots appear as separate entities even if they're in the same code chunk.

```markdown
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# First 7 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
           regex_pars = "b_(Intercept|visibilityPoor|lightNight|rdsfcondPoor|road_classMajor|road_classMinor|acclocOther)") +
           ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 1")
```
*Figure 1: Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 1*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Next 7 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
           regex_pars = "b_(acclocPrivate|traffctlOther|traffctlSignal|traffctlStop|impactypeApproaching|impactypeCyclistCollisions|impactypeOther)") +
           ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 2")
```
*Figure 2: Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 2*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Last 8 parameters
mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
           regex_pars = "b_(impactypePedestrianCollisions|impactypeRearEnd|impactypeSideswipe|impactypeSMVOther|impactypeSMVUnattendedVehicle|impactypeTurningMovement)") +
           ggtitle("Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 3")
```
*Figure 3: Trace Plots for Injury Occurrence Model - Part 3*
```

### Approach 3: Single Chunk with Clear Captions
You can group all the plots in a single chunk and add captions directly in the R code with `annotate` or `gridExtra`.

```r
library(gridExtra)

# Create individual plots
plot1 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(Intercept|visibilityPoor|lightNight|rdsfcondPoor|road_classMajor|road_classMinor|acclocOther)") +
          ggtitle("Part 1")

plot2 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(acclocPrivate|traffctlOther|traffctlSignal|traffctlStop|impactypeApproaching|impactypeCyclistCollisions|impactypeOther)") +
          ggtitle("Part 2")

plot3 <- mcmc_trace(as_draws(occurrence_model), 
                    regex_pars = "b_(impactypePedestrianCollisions|impactypeRearEnd|impactypeSideswipe|impactypeSMVOther|impactypeSMVUnattendedVehicle|impactypeTurningMovement)") +
          ggtitle("Part 3")

# Arrange them together
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol = 1)
```

This groups the plots while maintaining separate titles for each.

---

### Key Adjustments:
- Use **`patchwork`** or **`gridExtra`** for better layout control.
- Inline captions or figure descriptions can be added in R Markdown for clarity.
- Ensure each subplot has a clear title using `ggtitle()`.
